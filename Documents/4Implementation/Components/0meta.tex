\section{Components}
The functionality of the bus has been split into four components, that can be designed, implemented and tested independently. The following section will describe the components in this section. Additionally, the tracks will be tested using tracks designed specifically to test whether the components conform to the individual requirements \ref{Requirements}.

%This section lists the different prototypes with their design, purpose, and objectives that it needs to fulfil in order to be a completed prototype. Furthermore, it will describe the tracks that are designed for testing the functionality of each prototype. The prototypes will take base from the requirements in section \ref{Requirements}.

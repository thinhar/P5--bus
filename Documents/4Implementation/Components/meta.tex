\section{Components}
We have split the different functionality that the final bus needs into four components, that we can design, implement and test separately. We go through these components in this section. Additionally, we will test these using tracks designed specifically to decide whether the components conform to the requirements \ref{Requirements}.

%This section lists the different prototypes with their design, purpose, and objectives that it needs to fulfil in order to be a completed prototype. Furthermore, it will describe the tracks that are designed for testing the functionality of each prototype. The prototypes will take base from the requirements in section \ref{Requirements}.

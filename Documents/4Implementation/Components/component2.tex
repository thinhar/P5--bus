\subsection{2. Prototype - Bus stop procedure}
The second component is focused on detecting and performing a bus stop, and is built using the component of the steering object. 

Using the requirements, this component needs to:
    - Detect Bus Stops
    - Stop parallel to the curb
    - Stop within 1 cm of the curb
    - ... ? More?
\todo{}

As previously mentioned \ref{solvingRequirements}, we intend wish to detect a physical object emulating a sign and not just a drawing on the tracks. Towards this end we will be attempting to use a NXT CamV4 Sensor and some image recognition algorithm. 


The bus scale should be a close approximate of a real bus scale as \cite{DriveingCurves},

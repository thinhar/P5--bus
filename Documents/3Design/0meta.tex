\chapter{Design}

Using the data gathered in the previous chapter, we design a product that can solve the requirements listed in section \ref{Requirements}. In this chapter, we split the product into modular components that contain its functionality and use this to design the product architecture. Afterwards, we define interfaces to be used for implementing the software of the product. Besides the software, we also decide upon the physical design of the car and the track that it will need to drive on. 
%Lastly, we will plan how we are going to test whether the individual components of the car conform to the requirements or not.

To describe the architecture of the project, we loosely follow the 4+1 architectural view model. This describes the design from different points of view, rather than only from a programmer perspective. 

Additional to the software and system architecture, we will also design the bus itself along with the track that it needs to drive on.

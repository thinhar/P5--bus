\subsection*{Software}
As for writing software for the NXT, it has been decided that the program is being written using nxtOSEK. C and C++ are both very powerful low-level languages, and it has a scheduling system that allows us to more easily plan how the program should prioritise. These played a big role in this decision. Not only that, the option to use the NXTBios allowed the program to reduce the concern of and memory issues that might occur when the program starts becoming bigger.

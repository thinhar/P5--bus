\section{Prototypes}
This section lists the different prototypes with their design, purpose, and objectives that it needs to fulfil in order to be a completed prototype. Furthermore, it will describe the tracks that are designed for testing the functionality of each prototype. The prototypes will take base from the requirements in section \ref{Requirements}.

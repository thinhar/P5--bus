\section{Initiating Problem}

In this section we describe the problem that initiates the project, getting us started on further analysis. 

At the current moment, we are experimenting with building an autonomous bus that can drive safely inside road markings and stop at marked locations to pick up imaginary passengers. 

Further academic points of interests that we intend to experiment with are:
- optimizing driving patterns (acceleration, braking, turning, swerving)
- testing whether we can reach the upper limits of the memory of the NXT programmable block with a large number of tasks

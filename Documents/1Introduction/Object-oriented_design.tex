\section{Object-Oriented Design}

We will now use object-oriented design to figure out how our own system should be, and figure out what the requirements for our system should be.

\subsection{Use Cases}
meta

Use case 1:\\
Goal: Switching into the bus lane\\
Primary actor: NXT\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: A sensor(Camera?) gives data to the NXT that it detects as being a bus stop. The NXT makes the bus turn its wheels and drive into the bus stop, parking it parallel to the line.

Use case 2:\\
Goal: Switching out of the bus lane\\
Primary actor: NXT\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The NXT counts to a specified time and then turns the wheels of the bus and drives the bus back into the main lane.

Use case 3:\\
Goal: Staying in lane\\
Primary actor: NXT\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The NXT makes the bus drive straight ahead in the lane. It detects the edge of the lane using a sensor(camera?), and makes sure that the bus does not drive over the edges of the lane by turning the wheels of the bus away from the edge.

Use case 4:\\
Goal: Preventing a collision\\
Primary actor: NXT\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The NXT makes the bus drive forward. A sensor signals to the NXT that the distance between the bus and an object in front of it is getting shorter. The NXT makes the bus brake to prevent a collision.

Use case 5:
Goal: Maintaining a speed\\
Primary actor: NXT\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The NXT wants to maintain a specific speed. The motors tell the NXT how many degrees they are turning, and the NXT already know the circumference of the wheels, thus by also knowing time it can figure out how fast the bus is going. If the NXT sees that the bus is starting to move slower it will add more power to the motors, and if it sees that the bus is starting to move too fast the NXT will slow down the motors.

Use case 6:\\
Goal: Knowing to pull over at the next bus stop\\
Primary actor: A hypothetical passenger.\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The hypothetical passenger signals to the NXT that it should make the bus stop at the next bus stop.

Use case 7:\\
Goal: Detecting a bus stop\\
Primary actor: NXT.\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The NXT continually scans the input from the sensor(Camera?) and if it detects a sign that there is a bus stop, then it will know that there is a bus stop.

Use case 8:\\
Goal: Overtaking an obstacle\\
Primary actor: NXT.\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: By sensor input the NXT knows that there is an object ahead of it that is not moving. The NXT will then try to steer the bus left around the object whilst staying within the outer edges of the lane.

Use case 9:\\
Goal: Stay below a certain speed\\
Primary actor: NXT.\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: The NXT monitors the speed of the bus by knowing knowing the circumference of the wheels and knowing how fast they turn. The NXT then slows down the motors if they begin to approach a set speed limit.

Use case 10:\\
Goal: Ensuring that not too many passengers are on the bus\\
Primary actor: NXT.\\
Scope: A bus system\\
Level: ! User goal\\
Story: Every time a hypothetical passenger gets onboard the bus the NXT will count them. Every time a passenger gets off the bus, the NXT will also count them. The NXT prevents more passengers from getting onboard the bus if the limit for total amount of passengers have been reached.

\chapter{Problem Statement and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design}

%With all of the focus on self-driving vehicles we have chosen to specifically take a closer look at how buses can be automated to fulfil their objectives as if driven by a person.

%\section{Problem Statement}

In this chapter the problem statement is presented and the problem domain will be analysed using object oriented analysis. Then describe the relevant requirements for our project and limit our scope.

\section{Problem Statement}

\textbf{By examining the core functionality of a typical bus and limiting ourselves to LEGO hardware, we seek to construct an autonomous bus, that is able to perform the functionality required of a typical bus, in a scaled down version of pre-existing road infrastructure.}


\textbf{\info{Does it work better when it is setup like this?}
The core functionality of a typical bus will be examined.\\
We will limit ourselves to LEGO hardware.\\
We seek to construct an autonomous bus that works in real-time.\\
The bus should be able to perform the functionality of a typical bus.\\
The entire system is based on the pre-existing road infrastructure, although scaled down in size.}


%\info{In this version of the problem statement it is already specified from the very start that the focus is on the LEGO.}
%\info{Is the last part really needed?}
%\textbf{Is it possible to create a self-driving bus while working within the hardware limitations of LEGO, that is able to perform the functionality required of a typical bus, in a scaled down version of pre-existing infrastructure.}

%Another one:

%How to construct an autonomous bus using LEGO hardware and bricks, that is able to perform the core functionality of a typical Danish city bus. That can drive on a scaled down version of a part of the Danish road infrastructure.

%A third one:

%Is it possible to create a self-driving bus while working within the hardware limitations of LEGO, that is able to complete the objectives that are required for a typical bus, in a scaled-down version of the pre-existing infrastructure?



% The problem statement needs to set up the following:
% - That we actually BUILD a bus 
% - That we build a bus using LEGO (meaning either nxt or ev3)
% - That we build it to work on a scaled down version of danish infrastructure

% I think the following describes it the best:
% The purpose of the project is to construct an autonomous bus that can function in a scaled down version of pre-existing road infrastructure.

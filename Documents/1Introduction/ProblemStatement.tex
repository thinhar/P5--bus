\chapter{Problem Statement and Requirements}

%With all of the focus on self-driving vehicles we have chosen to specifically take a closer look at how buses can be automated to fulfil their objectives as if driven by a person.

%\section{Problem Statement}

In this chapter the problem statement will be presented and the problem domain will be analysed using various methods. This is done to find relevant requirements for our project, and limit our scope from the start. \unsure{maybe reword this}

\section{Problem Statement}
\textbf{Is it possible to create a self-driving bus using LEGO hardware, that is able to perform the functionality required of a typical bus, in a scaled down version of the pre-existing infrastructure.}
%\info{In this version of the problem statement it is already specified from the very start that the focus is on the LEGO.}
%\info{Is the last part really needed?}
%\textbf{Is it possible to create a self-driving bus while working within the hardware limitations of LEGO, that is able to perform the functionality required of a typical bus, in a scaled down version of pre-existing infrastructure.}

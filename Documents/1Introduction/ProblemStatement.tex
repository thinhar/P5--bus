\chapter{Problem Statement and Requirements}

%With all of the focus on self-driving vehicles we have chosen to specifically take a closer look at how buses can be automated to fulfil their objectives as if driven by a person.

%\section{Problem Statement}

\textbf{Is it possible to create a self-driving bus using LEGO hardware, that is able to perform the functionality required of a typical bus, in a scaled down version of the pre-existing infrastructure.}
\info{In this version of the problem statement it is already specified from the very start that the focus is on the LEGO.}
%\textbf{Is it possible to create a self-driving bus while working within the hardware limitations of LEGO, that is able to perform the functionality required of a typical bus, in a scaled down version of pre-existing infrastructure.}

\section{Project Requirements} \todo{Should be made more specific} \label{Requirements}
In this section we describe the requirements that the final product will need to meet in order to solve the problem statement. %...the requirements for the project will be described. The requirements are meant to be guidelines for the project and the goals which need to be met. The order of appearance is dependant on their importance.

%To test if the bus is able to meet its requirements, test tracks will be constructed. The requirements for the track and the bus will be specified below.
\info{This section should concern additional elaboration of the chosen requirements from the brainstorm. It should not contain design choices, and it is also doubtful that the requirements should be split into vehicle requirements and track requirements.}

%\subsection{Vehicle Requirements}
%Metatext

\begin{description}
    \item [(1) Follow Track]
    The bus needs to be able to detect the lines marking the edges of a road lane and stay within these. The relation between the size of the track and the LEGO bus should be the same as the relation real busses have with real roads. This also applies to the turning degrees of real road turns. 
    
    \item[(2) Stop at Bus Stops]
    The bus needs to detect and stop at bus stops on its route and resume driving afterwards. 

    \item[(3) Switching Lanes] 
    The vehicle should be able to switch lanes, useful both for overtaking other vehicles and stopping at a bus stop in a dedicated lane. 
    
    \item[(4) Detecting Obstacles]
    Detecting obstacles is a crucial part of preventing crashes and other potential accidents. As such the bus needs to be able to detect obstacles in front of it and perform preventative measures to prevent the collision. Implemented in the real world, the response, response time and field of view should be at least on par with normal human drivers. Seeing as this is highly improbable and unnecessary for a LEGO bus, we will consider this requirement fulfilled as long as it can: detect and react to obstacles in a 60 degree cone to the front within less than a second, and detect and react to obstacles within a 150 degree arch whenever the vehicle is switching lanes. \unsure{what are the rules for human? How many degrees do they need to watch (counting the mirrors)?}
    
    \item[(5) Stop Button]
    Busses, unlike trains, are not required to stop at every bus stop, and as such need a button that allows the passengers to signal at which stops they want to get off at. The bus should be able to at any given time receive a signal, and processes this signal as theoretical passengers wanting to get of the bus.
    
    \item[(6) Speed Limiter]
    The bus should have a speed limiter which can detect the current speed limits and keep the specific velocity in the different speed zones. It should be able to switch between at least 2 different speeds, given 2 different signals/physical signals.
    
    \item[(7) Indicator Signals]
    Signalling that a vehicle wants to turn is very helpful for the other vehicles on the road. The bus should have some way of indicating to the surroundings that it is turning/going to turn.
\end{description}

%\subsection{Lego vehicle and sensors requirements}
%This subsection will decide upon the requirements for the LEGO bus and the sensors that it uses.

%\subsubsection{Motors}
%The LEGO vehicle should use two servo motors\unsure{is this not a design thing? why is this a requirement}? One for the turning mechanism and one for driving forward and backwards. The turning mechanism should be the front wheels. 
%The LEGO bus needs a number of motors in other to drive itself forwards and backwards and in order to steer.\info{Have changed this subsection to be much less specific.}

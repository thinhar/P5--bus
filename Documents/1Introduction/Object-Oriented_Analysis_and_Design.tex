\section{Object-Oriented Analysis and Design}
%In this section we will use the object-oriented methods for analysis and design to gain more knowledge about how the system for busses currently work, and then figure out how we will build our own system.

%This section is split into two parts. The first part is the object-oriented analysis of the problem, and the second part is the object-oriented design for our own system.
In this section our object-oriented analysis \& design will be described, based on the book \textit{Object oriented analysis \& design}\cite{OOAD}. The purpose of this section is to analyse the problem-domain and model the application based on use cases. The result of this is our project requirements with corresponding priority.

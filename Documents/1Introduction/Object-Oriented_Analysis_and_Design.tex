\section{Object-Oriented Analysis and Design}
In this section we will use the object-oriented methods for analysis and design to gain more knowledge about how the system for busses currently work, and then figure out how we will build our own system.

This section is split into two parts. The first part is the object-oriented analysis of the problem, and the second part is the object-oriented design for our own system.

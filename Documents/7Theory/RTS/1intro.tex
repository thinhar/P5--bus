\section{Theory of Real Time Systems}



%\subsection{Focus on real-time systems} \todo{This section has been moved and thus the section is not correct anymore. A bit of the section might be salvageable, but much of it will have to be removed or otherwise changed.}
%As written in section \ref{Requirements} the project involves a vehicle, that has to detect and react to the tasks ahead, like detecting bus stops or avoid obstacles, further described in the requirements. In general, the solution will be a control system for the vehicle which has to handle many different tasks. Therefore it is critical that the deadlines for the different functions are met if the actions that the control system takes is to be correct.

%For example, if the obstacle detection system were to miss a deadline, the vehicle could crash and thereby get destroyed, because it did not check if that it was driving into an obstacle.

%Since the control of the vehicle is to be autonomous and the environment can change, the vehicle has to react to the changes in real-time. The control system could, therefore, contain both hard and soft real-time deadlines, the difference is explained in\todo{add ref ref{theory of RTS}}. It is therefore important that a schedule is made to handle the many activities, and ensure that no computations are catastrophic for the control system. 

%It has been decided to focus on real-time systems. The decision of the control system will be hard- or soft real-time systems can be found in section \todo{add ref: ref{SoftwareDesign}}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item All 4 wheels of the bus must stay within the lines at all time.
    \item The bus must be able to move itself from the start of the track to the end of the track.
    \item The bus should be able to complete the track in a somewhat timely manner.\info{Is this description too lose?}
\end{itemize}

The results of the tests are blablabla...

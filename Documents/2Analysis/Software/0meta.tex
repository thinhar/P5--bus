\todo{I am not happy about the order of decisions here. First: decide that we use Nxt. Then, explain why we use scheduling in this project. Then explain that we might as well use .oil and priority based because of the Nxt. Then describe priority based scheduling.     Agreed! I've switched the two chapters, but they still need to be modified for it to work.}

\subsection{Software Analysis}

\todo{I am not happy about the order of decisions here. First: decide that we use Nxt. Then, explain why we use scheduling in this project. Then explain that we might as well use .oil and priority based because of the Nxt. Then describe priority based scheduling.}


In the following section, an analysis of software for the LEGO NXT will be performed. The software that will be analyses is NXT-G, RobotC, leJOS, and nxtOSEK.

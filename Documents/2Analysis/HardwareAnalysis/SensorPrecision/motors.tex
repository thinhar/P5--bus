\subsection{Motors} \label{analysisMotors}

In this subsection we will take a closer look at the motor. Since we chose the NXT as our platform there is only one option for our motor: the NXT motor.

- Takes PWM as input for controlling the speed; returns the completed rotations and degrees of the next rotation.

It needs to be able to drive at at least two (noticeably) different velocities.

Testing whether one motor can pull it has to be done after the last component and after the bus has been built, because we do not know the weight of it. 
Until then we can test...?\todo{finish writting this?}

\subsection{Motors} \label{analysisMotors}

In this subsection, we will take a closer look at the motor. Since we chose the NXT as our platform there is only one option for our motor: the NXT motor.


The motor takes PWM as input for controlling the speed; returns the completed rotations and degrees of the next rotation.

The motor is supplied by a 9 V source. It's stalled torque is 50 N.cm, and it's stalled current is 2 A. The motor has a weight of 80g. Its maximum rotations per minute are 170, and its no-load current is 60 mA.\cite{motors}

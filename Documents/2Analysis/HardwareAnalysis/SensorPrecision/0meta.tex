%\subsubsection{Sensor Precision Testing}
%The purpose of this subsubsection is to test the sensors available, to assess their precision and eventual quirks that we should keep in mind during further work. Afterwards we will compare our results to the associated datasheets.
%\todo{Mention our project specific requirements/hypothesis (which doesn't exist yet).}

%\subsubsection{Expectations}
%We expect that the sensors will be wildly inaccurate, and that we will manually need to include the results of these measurements in further work, in order for it to not hurt the product and its reliability.

%\subsubsection{Planning}
%We have the following sensors, many of which will need to be tuned to the same input:
%1x LEGO Ultrasound Sensor
%- Returns 10 bits, corresponding to distance in cm. from an obstacle.
%2x LEGO Light Sensor
%- Returns a 10 bit unsigned integer describing how much light is picked up by the sensor.

%More to be added soon...\todo{Finish writing this.}

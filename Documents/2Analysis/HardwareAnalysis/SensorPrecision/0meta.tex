\subsection{Sensor Precision Testing}
The purpose of this section is to test the sensors and motors available, to assess their precision and eventual quirks that we should keep in mind during further work. Afterwards we will compare our results to the associated datasheets.
\todo{Mention our project specific requirements/hypothesis (which doesn't exist yet).}

\subsubsection{Expectations}
We expect that the sensors will be wildly inaccurate, and that we will manually need to include the results of these measurements in further work, in order for it to not hurt the product and its reliability.

\subsubsection{Planning}
We have the following sensors, many of which will need to be tuned to the same input:
1x LEGO Ultrasound Sensor
- Returns 10 bits, corresponding to distance in cm. from an obstacle.
2x LEGO Light Sensor
- Returns a 10 bit unsigned integer describing how much light is picked up by the sensor.

Additionally, motors, which will also need to be tested and compared for precision: 
2x LEGO Servo Motor
- Takes PWM\todo{} as input for controlling the speed; returns the completed rotations and degrees of the next rotation.

More to be added soon... \todo{}

\subsubsection{Light Sensor}

\todo{We are planning to emulate road markings using black tape. This necessitates that we use some sensor that can detect the colour or light difference between the tape and the rest of the track. These results should be the same regardless of any minor light level differences in the room, as long the room is still lit up akin to daylight. Put this into sensor testing: The light sensor assumes that the track and the lines have a large light difference and then it guarantees that it can detect the difference. Then later, during the design of the track, we know that black tape on white paper satisfies the assumptions made by the light sensor}

\subsection{Sensors} \todo{Until now we have only decided what the bus should be able to do, and the we will use LEGO NXT to fulfil these requirements. So in this section we both analyse and test the different sensors to figure out what they can be, and we also need to decide upon which sensor will be chosen before the chapter is done. --> Write here that the results of the analysis and results of the different sensors are. We will not make a choice until the design chapter though. Everything that does not relate to the sensors which we will be using will be removed.}%\todo{Find some way to merge this subsection with the sensor precision testing.} Refactoring the subsection
%\info{old}In this subsection we document our initial experiments with the NXT sensors, where we tried to see if they could even work for our intended purposes. Later, some of these sensors have been tested thoroughly to judge their precision and calibrate their measurements.

\info{new} In this subsection we will analyse and test the different NXT sensors to figure out how they function. We will not chose what sensors we will use in this chapter, we will instead wait until the design chapter to do so.
After we have analysed the sensors we will compare them to our datasheets.

%\input{Documents/2Analysis/HardwareAnalysis/SensorViability/accelerometer}  Since we do not use this for anything we have chosen to cut it out.

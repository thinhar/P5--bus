\subsection{Sensor Experiments}\todo{Find some way to merge this subsection with the sensor precision testing.}
In this section we document our initial experiments with the NXT sensors, where we tried to see if they could even work for our intended purposes. Later, some of these sensors have been tested thoroughly to judge their precision and calibrate their measurements.

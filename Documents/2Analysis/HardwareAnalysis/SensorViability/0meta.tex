\subsection{Sensors}
In this subsection the hardware components are chosen, described and tested. The purpose is to find the best hardware components based on the project requirements\ref{Requirements}, as well as the precision of each of these components, so the design phase can take \unsure{Eng ord for "Forbehold"} for this. 


\todo{afsnit omkring valg af hardware components}


%The hardware components has been choosen based on the problem statement and the project requirements. 

%since replacing the hardware is not possible in this project because the hardware components.


%In this subsection, we will analyse and test the ultrasonic sensor, and the camera, to figure out how they work and how precise they are. Some other sensors are also used but an analysis of them is not of high priority.

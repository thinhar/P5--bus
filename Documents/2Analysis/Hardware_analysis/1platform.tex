In this chapter we will have a closer look at the possible hardware components that will be used to construct the bus. The first section will be about the platform the the bus will be build upon. There options for platforms are: Lego NXT, Lego EV3, and Arduino\todo{If we get more platforms, these will need to be added.}.
The second section will be about the possible sensors for the Bus. The options are: Lego ultrasound sensor, Lego light sensor, Lego NXT cam, and NXT acceleration sensor.\todo{We have already decided the sensors we use before they are even tested, this means that there are some sensors that could have been viable candidates which are not tested and analysed.}
The third section is about the possible motors that we can use to make the bus move. The possible option is: NXT motor\todo{We only have a single option here.}
At the end of every section there will be a small discussion where the choice of hardware is made. This choice will influence the the possible options for hardware in the sections following that section.

\section{Platform}

The hardware platform have all sensors and motors attached to it. The hardware platform runs the software to make the bus use it's sensors and motors. As mentions the options are: Arduino, Lego NXT, and Lego EV3 

\subsection{Arduino}



\subsection{Lego NXT}

The Lego NXT set was released late July of 2006

\subsection{Lego EV3}
